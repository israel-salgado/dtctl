Lists the Dynatrace platform token scopes required for each dtctl safety level.
Copy the scope list for your desired safety level when creating a token in Dynatrace.

Note: Safety levels are client-side only. The token scopes you configure in
Dynatrace are what actually controls access. Configure your tokens with the
minimum required scopes for your use case.

Quick Reference:

  Safety Level                Use Case                                Token Type
  readonly                    Production monitoring, troubleshooting  Read-only token
  readwrite-mine              Personal development, sandbox           Standard token
  readwrite-all               Team environments, administration       Standard token
  dangerously-unrestricted    Dev environments, bucket management     Full access token
